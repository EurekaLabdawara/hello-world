# hello-world

Hi Everybody!
Today is my first day using GitHub. I'm amaze to know that GitHub is a powerfull tool that can help me learn and discuss more about coding (more than my social media).
What my interest and what i have learned past this years is c++, C#, java, vb, html, php, css, and sql. Hope our interest is same.
I'm a curious and a learner addicted person, so feel free to discuss any programming with me too.
I hope this is gonna be fun for the next years.
Thank you to all of you who read this.
